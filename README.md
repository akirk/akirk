## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an [active contributor to WordPress.org Meta](https://profiles.wordpress.org/akirk), leading a team at [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) working on [WordPress playground](https://playground.wordpress.net/), [the translation infrastructure](https://translate.wordpress.org), [Data Liberation](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/02/19/data-liberation-next-steps/), and, [previously, Matrix](https://make.wordpress.org/project/2023/12/12/update-on-matrix-migration-pausing-the-transition/).

Browse [my repositories](https://github.com/akirk?tab=repositories&language=&sort=stargazers) to find all my open source activities which include many [WordPress plugins](https://alex.kirk.at/wordpress-plugins/), [little tools](https://alex.kirk.at/little-tools/), and contributions to open source projects I personally use.

Also make sure to check out my personal blog at https://alex.kirk.at/ where I write about my projects and occasionally comment on happenings on the Internet.
